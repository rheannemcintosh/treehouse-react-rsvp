# RSVP - React Application

This project is a React Application built by following the Treehouse Course **React By Example**. The project allows users to add guests to a guest list, as well as edit, confirm or delete a guest, and utilises a counter component to monitor the guests. A link to the original Treehouse Course can be found [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-by-example).

This is one of the many repositories I created whilst taking part in the Treehouse 100 Days of Code Challenge. I took part in this challenge to improve my skills in areas I already work in on a daily basis (PHP, JavaScript), revisit some old languages from my University days (Java, C++), as well as learning some new languages along the way (Python, GO).

## Project Overview
The Dice Roller Application is a Python command line application which I created at the start of my Python journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/project-breakdown). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse tutorial, with some small edits along the way.
